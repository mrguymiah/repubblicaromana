# Repubblica Romana

Repubblica Romana is an HPM Submod based around the events in Rome during the Liberal Revolution that swept through Europe. The Minister of the Interior, Pellegrino Rossi, was assassinated, causing the Pope to flee to neighboring Gaeta. In his absence, the government fell to liberal agitators who established the Roman Republic. This unrecognized government lasted for about a year until French soldiers were sent by Napoleon III to restore the papacy.
